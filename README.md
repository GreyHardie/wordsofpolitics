  In May of 2014 European citizens are electing a new European parliament. Opinion polls are forecasting an upsurge of right-wing populist parties.  To study the political discourse of these parties, six students of the University of Amsterdam (see Credits) have built this visualization tool. It allows you to track the Twitter and Facebook accounts of the major right-wing populist parties in four European countries: France, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.  You can also monitor the accounts of a selection of extreme right-wing parties in these countries and of a number of traditional mainstream parties.  The tool shows the words that are used on Facebook and Twitter, according to their respective frequencies. Moreover, to gain a deeper insight on the topics emerging, it shows co-occurrences. Finally, it allows you to compare wordsâ€™ usage among different parties and countries.  The tool is interactive, allowing you to dynamically explore the words and their relations. For further instructions please refer to the How to section.
