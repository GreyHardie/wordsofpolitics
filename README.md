About
-------
<p>In May of 2014 European citizens are electing a new European parliament. Opinion polls are forecasting an upsurge of right-wing populist parties.</p>

<p>To study the political discourse of these parties, six students of the University of Amsterdam (see <em>Credits</em>) have built this visualization tool. It allows you to track the Twitter and Facebook accounts of the major right-wing populist parties in four European countries: <em>France</em>, <em>Italy</em>, <em>the Netherlands</em> and <em>the UK</em>.</p>

<p>You can also monitor the accounts of a selection of extreme right-wing parties in these countries and of a number of traditional mainstream parties.</p>

<p>The tool shows the words that are used on Facebook and Twitter, according to their respective frequencies. Moreover, to gain a deeper insight on the topics emerging, it shows co-occurrences. Finally, it allows you to compare words’ usage among different parties and countries.</p>

<p>The tool is interactive, allowing you to dynamically explore the words and their relations. For further instructions please refer to the <em>How to</em> section.</p>

How to
-----------
<p>This visualization has three views:</p>

<h4 id="view-1-country-overview">View 1 - Country overview</h4>

<ul>
<li>Shows word bubbles of the most frequently used words by the four countries considered. </li>
<li>The word bubbles are color coded according to the country that uses them and the size of the bubble is proportional to the frequency of its use.</li>
<li><strong>Double clicking</strong> on a country label focuses the view on that country and its words. Another <strong>double-click</strong> on the country label reverts the view back to the original state.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="view-2-political-party-overview">View 2 - Political party overview</h4>

<ul>
<li>Shows word bubbles of the most frequently used words by the political parties in a selected country <br>
<ul><li>The country is selected by a <strong>single-click</strong> on the country label in <em>View 1</em></li></ul></li>
<li>The word bubbles are color coded according to the country that uses them and the size of the bubble is proportional to the frequency of its use.</li>
<li>The words are attracted to the political parties in proportion to their use, and this determines their positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Double clicking</strong> on a political party label focuses the view on that party and its words. Another <strong>double-click</strong> on the party label reverts the view back to the original state.</li>
<li><strong>Double clicking</strong> on a word focuses the view on that word and shows its usage amongst the parties. Another <strong>double-click</strong> on the word reverts the view back to the original state.</li>
<li>In a focused view, edges or links are displayed between the words and the parties, the thickness of the edge is proportional to how frequently that word is used by the party.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="view-3-word-co-occurrence">View 3 - Word co-occurrence</h4>

<ul>
<li>Selecting a party and a word in <em>View 2</em>, populates this view. Selection is performed by a <strong>single-click</strong> on the party and word of interest.</li>
<li>This view then shows usage of the word selected, for the party selected. If no party was selected then it is the words usage for all parties shown from that country.</li>
<li>Distributed around the selected word are the words most commonly used together with the selected word (the <em>co-occurrences</em>). </li>
<li>The word bubbles are color coded according to the country that uses them.</li>
<li>The size of the selected word bubble is proportional to the frequency of its use.</li>
<li>The size of the co-occurrence word bubbles are proportional to the frequency of co-occurrence.</li>
<li>This view is divided into a left and a right side so that two words can be compared. By <strong>clicking</strong> on a side,  that side becomes selected and the word that appears in it will be changed by clicking in the previous views as described above. The selected side is clearly indicated by the word <em>“Selected!”</em> that appears on the appropriate side.</li>
<li>Hovering the mouse over a word will display the original tweets from which the co-occurrences where extracted.</li>
</ul>
